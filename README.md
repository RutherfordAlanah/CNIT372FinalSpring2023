# CNIT372FinalSpring2023

We created a database based on an application of an ice cream shop called Frostbite Ice Cream. The database keeps track of the business's customers and orders across multiple locations. This project serves to help the business get answers to questions that can provide value to the business.

In order to get access to the databse please run the ```load_script.sql``` file on your SQL developer. This will add all the required data.

Then make sure to run the ```package.sql``` file. This will create the package spec called ```Frostbite_IceCream_Question``` that contains all procedures used to answer each question. Run a question's procedure individually or simply run the ```Print_Answers_To_All_Questions``` procedure from the package to obtain all answers at once. 

We have divided the files in terms of individual contribution.
